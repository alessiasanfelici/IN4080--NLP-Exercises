    "## Part 1: Retrieval-based chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a retrieval-based chatbot based on a dialogue corpus of movie and TV subtitles. More specifically, we will rely on a pre-trained neural language model ([BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)) to convert each utterance into a fixed-size vector. This conversion will allow us to easily determine the similarity between two utterances using cosine similarity. Based on this similarity metric, one can easily determine the utterance in the corpus that is most similar to a given user input. Once this most-similar utterance is found, the chatbot will select as response the following utterance in the corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "To work on this chatbot, you need to install the `sentence-transformers` package (see [sentence-BERT](https://sbert.net) for details): \n",

    "We'll work with a dataset of movie and TV subtitles for English from the [OpenSubtitles 2018](https://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles-v2018.php) dataset and restricted for this assignment to comedies. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is in the gzip-compressed file `data/en-comedy.txt.gz`. The data contains one line per utterance. Dialogues from different movies or TV series are separated by lines starting with `###`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first task will be to read through the dataset in order to extract pairs of (input, response) utterances. We want to limit our extraction to ``high-quality'' pairs, and discard pairs that contain text that is not part of a dialogue, such as subtitles indicating _\"(music in background)\"_. We want to enforce the following criteria:\n",
    "1. The two utterances should be consecutive, and part of the same movie/TV series.\n",
    "2. `###` delimiters between movies or TV series should be discarded.\n",
    "3. Pairs in which one utterance contains commas, parentheses, brackets, colons, semi-colons or double quotes should be discarded.\n",
    "4. Pairs in which one utterance is entirely in uppercase should be discarded.\n",
    "5. Pairs in which one utterance contains more than 10 words should be discarded.\n",
    "6. Pairs in which one utterance contains a first name should be discarded (see the JSON file `first_names.json` to detect those), as those are typically names of characters occurring in the movie or TV series. \n",
    "7. Pairs in which the input utterance only contains one word should be discarded (as user inputs typically contain at least two words).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can of course add your own criteria to further enhance the quality of the (input, response) pairs. If you want the chatbot to focus on a specific subset of movies (like TV episodes from the eighties) you are also free to do so. "

    "Let's assume you wish to integrate a (spoken) conversational interface to one of the elevators in the IFI building. The elevator should include the following functions: \n",
    "- If the user express a wish to go to floor $X$ (where $X$ is an integer value between 1 and 10), the elevator should go to that floor. The interface should allow for several ways to express a given intent, such as \"_Please go to the $X$-th floor_\" or \"_Floor $X$, please_\".\n",
    "- The user requests can also be relative, for instance \"_Go one floor up_\".\n",
    "- The elevator should provide _grounding_ feedback to the user. For instance, it should respond \"_Ok, going to the $X$-th floor_\" after a user request to move to $X$.  \n",
    "- The elevator should handle misunderstandings and uncertainties, e.g. by requesting the user to repeat, or asking the user to confirm if the intent is uncertain (say, when its confidence score is lower than 0.5). \n",
    "- The elevator should also allow the user to ask where the office of a given employee is located. For instance, the user could ask \"_where is Erik Velldal's office?_\", and the elevator would provide a response such as \"_The office of Erik Velldal is on the 4th floor. Do you wish to go there?_\".  Of course, you don't need to write down the office locations of all employees in the IFI department, we'll simply limit ourselves to the 10 names provided in the `OFFICES` dictionary (see below).\n",
    "- The elevator should also be able to inform the user about the current floor (such as replying to \"_Which floor are we on?_\" or \"_Are we on the 5th floor?_\"). \n",
    "- Finally, if the user asks the elevator to stop (or if the user says \"_no_\" after a grounding feedback \"_Ok, going to floor $X$._\"), the elevator should stop, and ask for clarification regarding the actual user intent. \n"
